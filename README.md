# 🌤️ Weather App

A dynamic weather web application that shows real-time weather data with **immersive background videos** that change based on the current weather conditions, snowy/cold scenes for cold weather and sunny visuals for hot weather!

## 🌟 Features

- **Search any city** to instantly get current weather
- **Dynamic video backgrounds** that match the weather:
- Cold & snowy video for low temperatures
- Sunny video for warm/hot temperatures
- Displays temperature, weather conditions, and more
- **Search history** — keeps track of your previously searched cities
- Fast and lightweight — built with Node.js and EJS


## 🎥 How the Dynamic Background Works

The app checks the current temperature of the searched city:

- 🥶 **Cold weather** (below a set temperature threshold) → plays a **snow/cold wind video** in the background
- ☀️ **Hot/warm weather** (above the threshold) → plays a **sunny/bright video** in the background

This gives the user an immersive visual experience that matches real-world conditions!
